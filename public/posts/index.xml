      <description>A few years ago I was about an hour away from boarding a flight to New York when a stranger in front of me just plainly asked &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s happening in Kaunas in 2022?&amp;rdquo;. Honestly, it threw me off a little until I realized I was wearing a T-Shirt with &amp;ldquo;Kaunas 2022&amp;rdquo; written all over it. After quickly gathering my thoughts, I launched into a pitch.
I talked about what the European Capital of Culture is, how every year a few new cities take the title, what it means, and how Kaunas is going to be different.</description>

      <description>I love experimentation, iteration, creating proofs of concept. I, also, strongly believe that any code that is not in production is completely useless. That being said, as a person who ships software products for a living, the #1 struggle I have is launching something that is “good enough”.
Product launch that is “good enough” really means that:
“We just launched something that meets some baseline expectations of our potential buyers who use similar products already”.</description>
